PONG GAME 

A game inspired by Pong, one of the earliest arcade video games. Two paddles represent two players on a board. The up/down and a/z keypress move the paddles vertically along the left and right of the board. The object of the game is to hit the ball with one's paddle and send it back to the opposing side. A score is generated when the other player fails to return the ball to the other side and so the ball exits the board.
